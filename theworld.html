        In a general context, The World Tarot card signifies having the world at
        your feet! This can be in a literal sense as The World is one of the
        Travel cards of the Major Arcana. It can represent new worlds opening up
        for you so you can expect to be welcomed by the people in the countries
        you travel to. The World can also mean you will have the world at your
        feet in another sense, i.e. that you will be successful and the
        opportunities available to you at the moment are endless. You have gone
        through the trials and tribulations of the rest of the Major Arcana, you
        have endured the hardships and learned your lessons and now you will
        reap the rewards. You should be proud of what you have achieved, it has
        not been easy to get here but you’ve done it. The universe is smiling
        upon you and luck is on your side when this Major Arcana card appears in
        your reading so grab the opportunities available to you. The World can
        represent the completion of a challenge such as a university course or a
        project or can represent finally achieving a dream or aspiration such as
        starting your own business, getting married or having children. You have
        reached the point where you can be happy with what you have
        accomplished. Success can bring a whole new set of challenges or worries
        so make sure you’re not carrying the weight of the world on your
        shoulders. You’ve worked hard to get to this point so stop and savour
        the moment! Celebrate your accomplishments.
