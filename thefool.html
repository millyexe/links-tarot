      <h2>
        The first card of the Major Arcana, The Fool is generally a positive
        card indicating new beginnings. If it appears in your readings it could
        mean that you are on the verge of an exciting, unexpected new adventure.
        Your new adventure will bring you along a path which may require you to
        make a leap of faith but you will grow as a result of this new
        experience. This new adventure could be a literal new adventure, like
        travelling to a place you've never been before. The change this card can
        bring will usually be a welcome one. While the Fool is generally a
        positive card, its appearance in a reading can also indicate that you
        need to take the time to look before you leap.
